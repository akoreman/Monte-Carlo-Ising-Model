# Monte Carlo simulation of Ising Model

This project uses Markov chain Monte Carlo to simulate physical observables for the Ising model. See report in root for more details, this report also
mentions the CNN which can be found at https://github.com/akoreman/Convolutional-NN-Ising-Model-Temperature . Main simulation implemented using C#, data
analysis and plots made using Python and SciPy.
